# Megaventory-Intership-Project
In this project I used php and you will need xampp to run it,the file must be inside the htdocs folder inside the main xampps root folder 

the index.php file is our main page 

to run the script you must go to http://localhost/megaventory/index.php , megaventory is my projects folder 

The following 5 objects are calling their respective create method to create new entries in the megaventory database 

and in return we get the id of each new entity in the database
